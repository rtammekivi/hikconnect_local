#           firmware whose VTM channel never pushes — #33/#36/#37). Requires
#           HA to be on the same LAN as the doorbell. LAN protocol reverse

# How the live view is delivered to the frontend:
#   webrtc — HA Stream/go2rtc (HLS/WebRTC): has audio + low latency, but
#            depends on go2rtc and can't show HEVC without a transcode.
#   mjpeg  — a per-viewer ffmpeg decodes the stream to motion-JPEG: fully
#            codec-agnostic (H.264/HEVC), no go2rtc, robust for multiple
#            viewers, but no audio and one ffmpeg per viewer. Adapted from
#            albrzmr's fork.
#   auto   — probe the video codec once at startup and pick the mode:
#            H.264 → webrtc (audio + low latency), HEVC → mjpeg (browsers
#            can't show HEVC over WebRTC). Falls back to mjpeg (the safe,
#            always-works choice) if the codec can't be determined. This is
#            the default so users don't have to know their doorbell's codec.
